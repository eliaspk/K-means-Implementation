# K-means Implementation

## About the project
Implemented the k-means clustering algorithm to be used on the iris dataset. Centroid initialization is handled by initializing the first randomly, and the rest are determined by computing the point in the dataset with the maximum distance from the previous centroid.

## Usage
This project is also available on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@eliaspk/K-means-Implementation#Main.java)
